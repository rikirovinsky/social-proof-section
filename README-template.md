## My process

- There is not much to say. I started with finding the best solution for adjustable code to implement both mobile and desktop requierements. 
- I then played around with mixing grid and fles diplay. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learnt how to target specific part of the code in order to give it a specific format. It was a great experience to find how to use ID and Class in order to use a more versatile and copyable code.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to focus on using CSS grid and flex in order to improve versatility of site, so that they work better both on mobile and desktop devices.
